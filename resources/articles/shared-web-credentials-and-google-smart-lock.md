Shared Web Credentials for iOS and Google Smart Lock for Android will simplify
the login step for all users using native apps.
User having enabled these features, will be prompted in enabled apps to choose
which credentials to use, and they will be automatically filled in.

### Configuration

Shared Web Credentials and Google Smart Lock can be configured
in [SelfService](/selfservice/access/), under Basic settings.

If you experience any issues configuring or storing your settings
(i.e. getting a message like `Target site must match redirect URL domains!`),
your client type might be wrong. Please contact support and they will help you change that.
